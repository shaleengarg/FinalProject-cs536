In Figure~\ref{fig:motivation-io-analysis}, we study concurrent access in 
RocksDB, a popular persistent NoSQL database used by several applications
including ML applications~\cite{TF:LevelDB}. First, in RocksDB, close 
to \SK{90\%} I/O writes and reads that are smaller than 4K. Next, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation-io-analysis}, with increasing threads, 
close to 40\% access happen to shared logs and key-value store files.
