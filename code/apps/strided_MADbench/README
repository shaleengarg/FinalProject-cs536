mpiexec -n $NO_PROC MADbench2.x $NO_PIX $NO_BIN $NO_GANG $SBLOCKSIZE $FBLOCKSIZE $RMOD $WMOD $STRIDE

Parameters
NO_PIX      Sets the size of the pseudo-data - all the component matrices have NO_PIX x NO_PIX elements
NO_BIN      Sets the size of the pseudo-dataset - there are NO_BIN component matrices
NO_GANG     Sets the level of gang-parallelism - there are NO_GANG gangs
SBLOCKSIZE  Sets the ScaLAPACK blocksize - all matrices will be block-cycically distributed with side SBLOCKSIZE.
FBLOCKSIZE  Sets the file blocksize - all IO will start at a file-offset that is an integer multiple of FBLOCKSIZE.
RMOD        Sets the degree of simultaneous reading - 1:RMOD processors will read at once.
WMOD        Sets the degree of simultaneous writing - 1:WMOD processors will write at once.
RECORD      Sets the amount of read to be done at once (strided I/O) (bytes)
STRIDE      Sets the stride of read to (1+STRIDE)*RECORD 

Note: Stride and Record should be so chosen as the following conditions meet:
1. (RECORD)%sizeof(double)==0
2. (NO_PIX*NO_PIX*sizeof(double))%((1+STRIDE)*RECORD) == 0

TODO: MAX filesize is 2GB since I am using ints for most of the strided pattern code
